It is able to connect as a Master device to various types of Continuous Glucose Monitor systems and display their values on the screen. This is the main way that most people (usually patients with Type 1 Diabetes) will use the app. It is also able to act as a Follower device and pull remote CGM data from Nightscout . This is a great way for parents and care-givers to be able to remotely monitor loved ones and patients. FOR XDRIP+ USERS Please note that xDrip4iOS is not related to the xDrip+ project for Android . For help and information about the xDrip+ project for Android, please see here or look on Facebook . What Do I Need? \u2301 To run xDrip4iOS you will firstly need an iPhone 7 or newer running minimum iOS13. To work as a Master device, you will need to have a compatible CGM system (see below). If you want to share your CGM data with Nightscout, then you will also need a working internet connection. To work as a Follower device, you don't need anything except an internet connection and a working Nightscout site from where to follow the master device. That's it. Nothing else is needed. IMPORTANT Before using xDrip4iOS , it is important to understand several points: This is an open-source, community-based project and is not supported by any company It is not officially approved or regulated for diabetes therapy and/or treatment in any way whatsoever You must understand that you take full responsibility for using this software and you agree to do so at your own risk. Compatible Sensors \u2301 xDrip4iOS is compatible with many Libre sensors and also certain Dexcom sensors/transmitters.

Is it true that my sensor will be more accurate if I calibrate 3 times per day? \u2301 No. You should only calibrate when you need to . Ideally, if there is no change to the sensor reliability, then just one good calibration would last \"forever\". In reality, the sensor filament will slowly degrade whilst inside your body and lose accuracy. The area of tissue around the sensor may get slightly inflamed and your body may start to form scar tissue around the filament insertion path. These effects are generally very small, but can affect the accuracy of the readings taken from the sensor. The filament will likely also move slightly inside your arm (or wherever you have it inserted) and this will again cause slightly different readings. For these reasons, it's normal to have to calibrate maybe every 5-7 days... sometimes more, sometimes less. It should NEVER be necessary to calibrate every 12 hours or even every day. How do I make a good calibration? \u2301 The important thing is to always make a good calibration. That means following (at a minimum) the following rules strictly: Never calibrate against a Freestyle Libre \"scan\". Remember that the Libre is an uncalibrated source and although you could be lucky you should never assume it is accurate (it usually won't be for most people). You should always calibrate against a blood glucose measurement (preferibly using a good quality blood glucose meter such as a Contour Next). Always calibrate when in a normal range (90-140mg/dl for example) Always calibrate when your blood glucose trend is stable . That means that it isn't noticeably rising or falling at all. If you have just eaten that, don't calibrate. If you have administered a bolus treatment over 20 minutes ago, don't calibrate either. You basically want to know that although your current sensor glucose trend is stable, there is nothing affecting what your actual blood glucose trend is doing. Remember that there is a small delay (10-15 minutes) between any blood glucose changes and this change being reflected in your sensor glucose values. Never calibrate outside of a normal range or when your sensor glucose trend is not stable. If you need to calibrate out of range (such as when starting a new sensor), do so and remember not to trust the values until you can calibrate again when back in range and stable Once you've done this and you can verify that the calibration accurately reflects future blood glucose values (again, when in target range and when stable), then you should only calibrate again if you are seeing differences of >10-15mg/dl against blood. if using non-fixed slope calibration, try and make a good calibration at around 80mg/dl and then another at around 150mg/dl. The rest of the rules still apply.","title":"Calibration best practices"},{"location":"advanced/calibration_best_practices/#calibration-best-practices","text":"","title":"Calibration Best Practices"},{"location":"advanced/calibration_best_practices/#why-is-it-important-to-calibrate-properly","text":"","title":"Why is it important to calibrate properly?"},{"location":"advanced/calibration_best_practices/#how-often-should-i-calibrate-is-it-true-that-my-sensor-will-be-more-accurate-if-i-calibrate-3-times-per-day","text":"No. You should only calibrate when you need to .

An APS works by reading blood glucose values, predicting/calculating the insulin requirement and automatically adjusting a user's insulin pump with the aim of keeping the user within their target blood glucose range. FreeAPS is a fork of the Loop project developed and maintained by Ivan Valkou . FreeAPS vs FreeAPS X?? This could get confusing, so pay attention: Ivan's original FreeAPS project is based on Loop and is what we are discussing on this page Ivan's newer FreeAPS X project is based on OpenAPS . It is a different system and is discussed here The main difference between Loop and FreeAPS is that FreeAPS is able to administer insulin delivery via micro-boluses instead of adjusting basal rates. Although Loop also now has an autobolus branch which is similar, FreeAPS is much more customizable and flexible. It is important to note that the app developer has decided to halt all active development on FreeAPS in order to concentrate all efforts on his new FreeAPS X project. Collaborators are encouraged to participate with the maintenance of the fork. Whereas Loop will only work with compatible Dexcom or Medtronic pump-connected sensors, FreeAPS also contains a Nightscout client which can be used to pull glucose data from the user's Nightscout site, or via apps (such as Spike) that have an internal http server that mimics a Nightscout server. Pulling data from the cloud, or using http servers on iOS, are potentially unstable options for an APS (although they will generally work well most times). Aleksandar Obucina has created a fork of Ivan's FreeASP (Loop). This includes an xdrip client written in Swift by Julien Groen . This modified version of FreeAPS has xDrip4iOS as a CGM option and will pull glucose data directly offline from xDrip4iOS without needing to use any intermediate services. It is necessary to clone, build and install Aleksandar's fork of FreeAPS and then do the same with the master branch of xDrip4iOS. Important: The Testflight version of xDrip4iOS cannot be used with FreeAPS. How do I install FreeAPS (Loop)? \u2301 Aleks' Github repository is here . In LoopDocs there is a nice page about cloning and building workspace files here . Please read the above page and ensure your Mac is fully updated (both MacOS and Xcode) and Xcode Command Line tools/Git are installed before proceeding. Clone the LoopWorkspace \u2301 First we need to create a folder where we will clone the source code and build the project. We recommened creating a folder in your Documents called \" FreeAPS \". Open Terminal on your Mac and type in the following to change to your Documents folder: (You can copy and paste the below text, one line at a time, pressing return after pasting each line) cd documents Create the new folder: mkdir freeaps Change into the newly created folder: cd freeaps We will now issue a Git command to clone (download) the current version of Aleks' repository into your new folder: git clone --branch=freeaps --recurse-submodules https://github.com/alekst1d/LoopWorkspace This will create a new folder called LoopWorkspace containing the source code. You should now navigate into this new folder: cd LoopWorkspace We will now open the workspace file in Xcode by typing the following: xed . Sign the Targets \u2301 As per a normal Loop build, you will need to sign the four targets using your Development Team. Signing will automatically set the Bundle Identifier for your app. You can change this, but be aware that it will then install a completely new FreeAPS app. It's better to just leave it as is. App Group \u2301 Please do not modify the App Groups at all. This is important to ensure integration with xDrip4iOS. How do I install xDrip4iOS? \u2301 You need to follow the Build From Source instructions. The common LoopKit app group is already written into the standard project file in xDrip4iOS so no need to touch anything. Operation \u2301 The operation of both FreeAPS (Loop) and xDrip4iOS is the same. The only thing needed is to add a CGM in FreeAPS and chose \"xDrip4iOS\".

We define the Alarm Types . These are different types of alarms that we can use to alert us to different types of events. We define the Alarms themselves. These trigger different types of alarm based upon certain events that happen or conditions that we decide. Before we continue... Let's just quickly get the concept clear. Take a deep breath and repeat after me... An Alarm Type can be used for many different Alarms . Any Alarm can only use one Alarm Type at a time. Alarm Types \u2301 Here we will define the different types of alarm that we will hear. If you go into Alarm Types, you will see that we there is a default Alarm Type set. We called it \"Default\"... because we're original and clever. You can modify this, or you can create your own Alarm Type.

Eventually, you will have different alarm types, matching your needs in terms of sounds and vibrations. Having several types will help you selectively disable some of them if necessary. Alarms \u2301 Now that we have an Alarm Type configured, we can configure the individual Alarms. An alarm will be triggered when the something meets a defined condition. For example you could define an alarm to be triggered: \"Sound an Low Alarm whenever my blood glucose drops below 60mg/dl \" \"Sound a High Alarm if my blood glucose goes over 250mg/dl \" \"Sound a Low Alarm When my blood glucose drops below 80mg/dl during the night\" \"Sound an alarm if xDrip4iOS has been Missing Readings from my sensor in the last 30 minutes \" \"Sound an alarm 72 hours after I last calibrated my sensor to remind me to calibrate again\" In the above examples, you will see two things. The Alarms that are available and the conditions that we can set for them to be triggered. Level alarms will trigger above (high) or below (low) a certain blood glucose level. Rise and drop alarms will trigger if blood glucose change over the last 2 readings (or 4 minutes for Libre 2 direct) is larger than the level you've setup. Missed readings will trigger after the defined time without receiving any blood glucose data. Calibrations needed alarm will trigger after the defined amount of hours since last calibration was entered in xDrip4iOS. Battery alarm will trigger when the battery falls below the defined percentage. Each alarm will use one of the alarm types you created, select the one you'd like to be used for this alarm event: You can also change the alarm type and threshold for certain moments of the day, for this you need to add alarms like in this example: Say you'd like to have your Low Alarm to trigger only at night time (22:00 to 7:00). Select your low alarm and add an alarm with the + icon top right. On the new Low Alarm, change Apply from to 7:00 and Ok. Set the Alarm Type and Done. You now have two different Low Alarms: Loud from 00:00 to 7:00 and quiet from 7:00 to 00:00. Now select the second alarm (starting at 7:00) and repeat the sequence with a new alarm starting at 22:00, alarm type Loud. Save. You now have the Low Alarm trigger with the alarm type Loud from 22:00 to 7:00 and the rest of the day with Quiet. You could also have modified the threshold value for different moments of the day. Volume Tests \u2301 They alarm will sound with the volume that your iPhone is set to. This could mean that you have the volume turned right down and would then not hear anything. In order to be able to quickly test what volume your alarms will sound at (before going to bed for example), you can click the Volume Test buttons. A sample Alarm sound will play and you can adjust the volume as required using the volume keys on the side of your iPhone. Then just click OK to stop the alarm.

Due to this, use careful consideration if you are about to apply a correction bolus because the app says that you have a high blood glucose OR before you decide to take in some fast carbs, because the app is saying you have a hypo, but you don't feel like it at all. It is always recommended to take a proper finger prick test if you have any doubts about the accuracy of the reading shown in the app. Please note The most of the example blood glucose values in this instruction text is in unit of mmol/l. You can transform these values to mg/dl by multiplying the mmol/l figure by 18 (i.e. 1 mmol/l = 18 mg/dl). What does \"Calibration\" mean? \u2301 Calibration is a functionality in many CGM apps with which user can make the calculations that use the sensor glucose (SG) readings sent by the sensor become much more accurate and closer to real blood glucose (BG). Why do we need to calibrate? \u2301 SG readings sent by your sensor are so called \"raw\" values and the accuracy of these raw values depend on many things. Typical variables that have an impact are the time of how long the sensor has been attached to your skin; sensors are typically less accurate \"right out of the box\" and also 1-3 days before they expire. This is a natural behaviour of sensors and is completely normal. You might have also inserted the sensor into an area on your skin where it's harder for the sensor to get accurate readings. Also even sensors themselves vary; sometimes you get an accurate one which behaves nicely the whole time it is inserted and throughout the BG range, the other time the sensor can be all over the place and might even stop working before the official usage period ends. All this means that if you find that you are not happy with the (non-calibrated) accuracy of your current sensor, the calibration methods provided by xDrip4iOS help you to mitigate the above mentioned variables to make the BG readings in the app much more accurate. Important No calibration can accurate readings provided by a faulty/noisy sensor. If the sensor is providing erratic and highly fluctuating SG values, it is impossible for any application to correct these and show accurate readings to the user. For this reason it might be difficult to calibrate, when a sensor is new and the readings have not yet steadied out. Algorithms and calibration methods \u2301 xDrip4iOS application offers three different ways how the app interprets the raw SG values provided by the sensor. Each xDrip4iOS user needs to consider that what is the best method for themselves to use. Libre algorithm (basic) xDrip algorithm with single-point calibration (recommended) xDrip algorithm with multi-point calibration (advanced use) Libre algorithm \u2301 Choose this method if you have just started to use xDrip4iOS and/or you are not (yet) familiar enough with the concept of calibration that you would like to try it out and/or you just want a simple setup and you are ok with the inaccuracies that come from this method. Libre algorithm is not an actual calibration method at all, but more of a default setting in the app for those users, who don't want to spend time on thinking when or how to calibrate. For this method the app has a specific built-in algorithm that applies a correction to the BG reading provided by the sensor and then the corrected BG reading is shown to the user. The user is not able to impact to the correction which is done by the algorithm. Please note Even if xDrip4iOS says that it uses Libre algorithm, there most likely are differences between the readings shown by LibreLink app and readings shown by xDrip4iOS. Please expect that there can be even relatively large differences between xDrip4iOS and your actual blood glucose reading. xDrip algorithm with single-point calibration \u2301 Choose this method, when you want to get more accurate readings from the app and you are ready to apply a calibration, but you don't necessarily want to calibrate that often. Single-point calibration is a way of calibration where you make only one calibration based on which the app then applies a fixed positive or negative correction for the raw values that the sensor is sending. Single-point calibration applies correction only via intercept of the calibration curve (please read below \"Advanced Calibration Explanations\"). xDrip algorithm with multi-point calibration \u2301 If you want the most accurate readings from the app and you are ready to pay more attention and to use more time on calibration. Multi-point calibration allows a way of calibration in which the user can enter different calibration values in different areas of the BG range which are then all taken into account when the app calculates the calibration curve. This means that the calibration curve can take into account the differences in the sensor raw value accuracy at low-end of BG range and in the high-end of BG range. The first calibration adjusts only the intercept of the calibration curve (please read below \"Advanced Calibration Explanations\") but the following calibrations after this adjust both the slope and the intercept. If done correctly, this calibration method can provide very accurate readings in the app, but if done wrongly also the magnitude of error can be much larger. In theory the more calibrations are added the more accurate the calibration becomes. However, in practice even just two good calibrations (one on the low-end of BG range and the other on the high-end) can make the calibration very accurate. This means that e.g. regular twice-a-day calibrations are not needed and they actually increase the possibility that the user eventually applies a faulty calibration, which makes the whole calibration go bad. Advanced Calibration Explanations \u2301 As described above, calibration is a way to reduce the inaccuracies that are coming from the sensor that you use. This section explains in more detail how Xdrip4iOS transforms the raw SG readings into calibrated BG readings that are then shown to the user in the main screen of the app. In practise the calibration is stored as a calibration curve in the app. This curve is used to apply a correction to the value provided by the sensor. This graph is not visible in the app, but can be described as a combination of slope and intercept - it makes it easier to understand these concepts, if you remember the lessons about 1st degree equations from the time you were in school :) Slope \u2301 The Slope describes the steepness/angle of the calibration curve. Slope (in the context of calibration) can be only positive and is typically something between 0,7-1,3. Slope is a multiplier that is applied to the raw value of the sensor throughout the BG range. If there is no calibration, slope gets a value of 1,0. Intercept \u2301 The Intercept describes a fixed correction that is added (when positive) or deducted (when negative) from the raw value. Typical values for intercept are between -2,0.... +2,0 (in mmol/l). If there is no calibration, intercept gets a value of 0. Example #1 Slope = 1,0 / Intercept = 0,0 Result = No calibration. Raw value from sensor is shown as-is in the app: if sensor gives 5,0 mmol/l reading, the app shows 5,0 mmol/l reading. Example #2 Slope = 1,0 / Intercept = 0,3 Typical example of single-point calibration, where the calibration applies a small, fixed correction over the whole BG range. Remember that intercept can also be negative. In practice 0,3 mmol/l is added (deducted, if negative intercept) to any sensor raw value: if sensor gives a raw value of 5,0 mmol/l, the app shows 5,3 mmol/l, if the sensor gives a raw value of 9,3 mmol/l, the app shows 9,6 mmol/l. Example #13 Slope = 1,2 / Intercept = 0,0 Example of a calibration, where only the slope of the calibration is adjusted. In practice this type of a calibration means that throughout the BG range, a multiplier of 1,2 is applied to the raw value: if sensor gives a raw value of 5,0 mmol/l, the app shows 6.0 mmol/l (5,0 x 1,2), if the sensor gives a raw value of 9,3 mmol/l, the app shows 11,2 mmol/l (9,3 x 1,2). Example #4 Slope = 1,2 / Intercept = 0,3 Typical example of multi-point calibration after the 2nd (or further) calibration has been done. This applies both the fixed correction as per the intercept and also a multiplier as per the slope value: if sensor gives a raw value of 5,0 mmol/l, the app shows 6,3 mmol/l (5,0 x 1,2 + 0,3), if the sensor gives a raw value of 9,3 mmol/l, the app shows 11,5 mmol/l (9,3 x 1,2 + 0,3). Calibration Best Practices \u2301 Calibrate only when your BG is steady. While a finger prick gives you an accurate BG reading straight from your blood at that time, a sensor attached to your skin measures and estimates BG readings from interstitial fluid under your skin. When your actual BG fluctuates, these changes appear in interstitial fluid only after a delay. This delay can be anything between 5-20 mins. This means that your BG must have been steady when you take a finger prick and must continue remaining steady in the app after you have applied a calibration. Calibration makes the BG reading typically to jump up or down, but the line should remain horizontal after this. You need to understand that the finger prick reading you see in BG reader, is shown in xDrip4iOS only after the above mentioned delay. If you calibrate when your BG is steady, you know that you are giving the app a chance to calculate the best possible calibration correction. If you calibrate, when BG is not steady, you are shooting a moving target. Being steady does not mean only that your actual BG is steady but that also the reading in the app is steady. Probably everyone who wears a sensor and has gone to swimming, in sauna, out in the cold, layed on a sofa pressure on sensor etc. etc. have seen that the sensor reading might suddenly rise or fall. If you calibrate when this happens, you can be certain that the applied calibration is bad and you get very inaccurate BG readings from the app. Over time, you might learn to make calibrations also when your BG is not 100 % steady, e.g. slowly coming down. This is however not recommended for newbies due to a high probability of making an error. Calibrate only when you are in range. There are two reasons to this: First reason is that you should not be too interested if you are 14 or 16 mmol/l or if you are 2,9 or 3,1 mmol/l. Either or, you know that you have a hyper or a hypo and you need to take actions. At this time the BG reading in the app and its accuracy does not matter that much. I.e. aim to get the in-range accuracy to be good and settle for that out-of-range accuracy might be so-so. Second reason is that the sensors themselves are the most accurate in range area and their inaccuracies increase when BG is outside the normal range. As we know, we want as accurate readings as possible, when calibrating, so you don't want to apply calibrations on top of inaccurate sensor readings. Of course, if the app says that you are out of range and shows 3,0 mmol/l but your actual BG (as per a finger prick) says 4,0 ( and your BG is steady), you can calibrate. No T1D wants to hear low alarms blazing, when they are not actually hypo'ing. Ensure you minimize the margin of error, when taking a finger prick : Use as accurate BG reader as possible. If you know that your sensor is inaccurate, consider updating it to a good one. Use strips that have not expired. While it's possible to use expired strips and get accurate readings with them as well, do you want to take the chance? Wash your hands before you take the reading. You might have some residues in your fingers, which impact the measurement - wash them off first. Don't squeeze your fingertip to get a blood drop out. Everyone knows how wild the sensor readings might be during the first 12-24 hours after a new sensor has been installed. This happens because the area where you applied the sensor is not yet used to the small filament that is inside your skin and via which the sensor takes readings. These sudden changes make also calibration more difficult. You can mitigate these if you attach a new sensor on your skin 12-24 hours before you actually take it in use . That way your skin has time to get used to the sensor and the readings are much more calm, when you start the sensor. If you calibrate during the 1st day of a sensor, that same calibration is most likely not accurate on the 10th day. It's good practice every once in a while to make a BG check with a finger prick when your BG is stable , and f the reading in Xdrip4iOS differs from that, you can consider calibrating. However, it doesn't necessarily make sense to calibrate if the difference is something like 0,1-0,4 mmol/l, because even the most accurate BG readers have some fault tolerance. It's more critical to be accurate in the lower-end of the scale than on the high side. So prioritize the accuracy of the low-end calibrations . For this it helps if you have installed (but not yet taken in to use) a new sensor but still taking the SG readings to Xdrip4iOS from the old one; when the readings are stable and at the low-end of the BG range, make a switch from old sensor to the new one. This way you can apply right away a good low-end calibration and be certain that at least the low alarms go off at the right time. You might screw an earlier nice calibration with just only one bad new calibration value. So don't calibrate for the sake of the calibration itself . When it comes to calibration, less is often more. You are not supposed to calibrate each and every day. If you feel like it and your BG is steady, you can do it, but it's completely fine to calibrate even just 3-4 times during the lifespan of a sensor. Make rather one good and accurate calibration than five sketchy ones. How to calibrate in xDrip4iOS? \u2301 Alright, if you've read these instructions this far, you are ready for calibration. This section gives you instructions on how you will apply a new calibration in xDrip4iOS. Select the calibration method you want to use: either \"Single-point calibration\" or \"Multi-point calibration\". You can make this selection in \"Bluetooth\" tab in the app inside your transmitter. On the main screen of the app, click \"Calibrate\" If you have just connected a new sensor (or resetted the calibrations by stop->start sensor), the app does not allow you to calibrate right away. You need to wait until the app gets at least two BG readings from the sensor, before a calibration can be applied. A pop-up opens, which asks you to enter a calibration value. Here you enter the value from your BG reader after a finger prick. DONE! After this, the app calculates the calibration curve as per the provided calibration value and starts to apply a correction to all the further BG readings coming from the sensor. Depending on the size of the calibration you did, you may notice right away that the graph on the screen of Xdrip4iOS jumped up or down - this is completely normal. It is also normal that the next BG value is not exactly the same value that you just entered as a calibration value. This happens because the entered calibration value is first used to calculate the new calibration curve and only this calibration curve (see \"Advanced Calibration Explanations\") is used to calculate the shown BG values in the app. Remember to monitor the readings in the app after a calibration; if they start to go up or down within 15-20 mins, there is a chance that your BG was not actually steady at the moment of the calibration, i.e. your actual BG had already started to change, but because this change was not yet visible in the app, the calibration was not accurate. Practice makes perfect and over time you might learn to do a relatively accurate calibrations, even when your BG is going slowly up or down, but the ground rule is: BG steady and in range. Please note If you notice that the calibration that you applied was bad (for whatever reason) and made the BG readings inaccurate, you can reset all the calibrations by stopping and starting the sensor. Unfortunately it is not possible to remove individual calibration values If you change the calibration method, it resets all the previous calibrations. Other notes \u2301 By default, xDrip4iOS has alerts to remind you to perform a calibration. If the app alerts you about this, it doesn't mean that you must do a new calibration. If you feel that these alerts/reminders occur too often, you can increase their interval. Often people turn calibration alerts even completely off. Sometimes a new calibration value makes the calibration slope and/or intercept to become something crazy without user noticing it right away. If you have a Nightscout installation, it is possible to see calibration curve there in the reports. There is a specific \"Calibrations\" report type for this. This report returns you the current and the past calibration graphs so that you can look at them and assess their accuracy. You can also compare the previous curve and the current curve and think how the calibration that you just did changed the curve. It is to be noted that in Nightscout reports, the calibration report shows the graph as inverted: sensor raw value is on Y axis and BG reading value after the calibration on the X axis. This means that you need to know how to read the graph and slope and intercept values reported by Nightscout - this part is not explained in these instructions more than these below: Values in these reports are shown based on 'mg/dl' and multiplied by 1000. On the report, the intercept value of \"-24000\" is actually a positive intercept of 24 mg/dl or 1,5 mmol/l On the report, the slope value of 1100 is actually slope of 0,91 (1/1,1)","title":"Calibration"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#calibration-of-xdrip4ios","text":"Disclaimer No matter which calibration method you decide to use and/or how good you are in calibrating, there are many reasons and factors why xDrip4iOS can show values that differ greatly from your actual blood glucose.

Single-point calibration applies correction only via intercept of the calibration curve (please read below \"Advanced Calibration Explanations\").","title":"xDrip algorithm with single-point calibration"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#xdrip-algorithm-with-multi-point-calibration","text":"If you want the most accurate readings from the app and you are ready to pay more attention and to use more time on calibration. Multi-point calibration allows a way of calibration in which the user can enter different calibration values in different areas of the BG range which are then all taken into account when the app calculates the calibration curve. This means that the calibration curve can take into account the differences in the sensor raw value accuracy at low-end of BG range and in the high-end of BG range. The first calibration adjusts only the intercept of the calibration curve (please read below \"Advanced Calibration Explanations\") but the following calibrations after this adjust both the slope and the intercept. If done correctly, this calibration method can provide very accurate readings in the app, but if done wrongly also the magnitude of error can be much larger. In theory the more calibrations are added the more accurate the calibration becomes. However, in practice even just two good calibrations (one on the low-end of BG range and the other on the high-end) can make the calibration very accurate. This means that e.g. regular twice-a-day calibrations are not needed and they actually increase the possibility that the user eventually applies a faulty calibration, which makes the whole calibration go bad.","title":"xDrip algorithm with multi-point calibration"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#advanced-calibration-explanations","text":"As described above, calibration is a way to reduce the inaccuracies that are coming from the sensor that you use. This section explains in more detail how Xdrip4iOS transforms the raw SG readings into calibrated BG readings that are then shown to the user in the main screen of the app. In practise the calibration is stored as a calibration curve in the app. This curve is used to apply a correction to the value provided by the sensor. This graph is not visible in the app, but can be described as a combination of slope and intercept - it makes it easier to understand these concepts, if you remember the lessons about 1st degree equations from the time you were in school :)","title":"Advanced Calibration Explanations"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#slope","text":"The Slope describes the steepness/angle of the calibration curve. Slope (in the context of calibration) can be only positive and is typically something between 0,7-1,3. Slope is a multiplier that is applied to the raw value of the sensor throughout the BG range. If there is no calibration, slope gets a value of 1,0.","title":"Slope"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#intercept","text":"The Intercept describes a fixed correction that is added (when positive) or deducted (when negative) from the raw value. Typical values for intercept are between -2,0.... +2,0 (in mmol/l). If there is no calibration, intercept gets a value of 0. Example #1 Slope = 1,0 / Intercept = 0,0 Result = No calibration. Raw value from sensor is shown as-is in the app: if sensor gives 5,0 mmol/l reading, the app shows 5,0 mmol/l reading. Example #2 Slope = 1,0 / Intercept = 0,3 Typical example of single-point calibration, where the calibration applies a small, fixed correction over the whole BG range. Remember that intercept can also be negative. In practice 0,3 mmol/l is added (deducted, if negative intercept) to any sensor raw value: if sensor gives a raw value of 5,0 mmol/l, the app shows 5,3 mmol/l, if the sensor gives a raw value of 9,3 mmol/l, the app shows 9,6 mmol/l. Example #13 Slope = 1,2 / Intercept = 0,0 Example of a calibration, where only the slope of the calibration is adjusted. In practice this type of a calibration means that throughout the BG range, a multiplier of 1,2 is applied to the raw value: if sensor gives a raw value of 5,0 mmol/l, the app shows 6.0 mmol/l (5,0 x 1,2), if the sensor gives a raw value of 9,3 mmol/l, the app shows 11,2 mmol/l (9,3 x 1,2). Example #4 Slope = 1,2 / Intercept = 0,3 Typical example of multi-point calibration after the 2nd (or further) calibration has been done. This applies both the fixed correction as per the intercept and also a multiplier as per the slope value: if sensor gives a raw value of 5,0 mmol/l, the app shows 6,3 mmol/l (5,0 x 1,2 + 0,3), if the sensor gives a raw value of 9,3 mmol/l, the app shows 11,5 mmol/l (9,3 x 1,2 + 0,3).","title":"Intercept"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#calibration-best-practices","text":"Calibrate only when your BG is steady. While a finger prick gives you an accurate BG reading straight from your blood at that time, a sensor attached to your skin measures and estimates BG readings from interstitial fluid under your skin. When your actual BG fluctuates, these changes appear in interstitial fluid only after a delay. This delay can be anything between 5-20 mins. This means that your BG must have been steady when you take a finger prick and must continue remaining steady in the app after you have applied a calibration. Calibration makes the BG reading typically to jump up or down, but the line should remain horizontal after this. You need to understand that the finger prick reading you see in BG reader, is shown in xDrip4iOS only after the above mentioned delay. If you calibrate when your BG is steady, you know that you are giving the app a chance to calculate the best possible calibration correction. If you calibrate, when BG is not steady, you are shooting a moving target. Being steady does not mean only that your actual BG is steady but that also the reading in the app is steady. Probably everyone who wears a sensor and has gone to swimming, in sauna, out in the cold, layed on a sofa pressure on sensor etc. etc. have seen that the sensor reading might suddenly rise or fall. If you calibrate when this happens, you can be certain that the applied calibration is bad and you get very inaccurate BG readings from the app. Over time, you might learn to make calibrations also when your BG is not 100 % steady, e.g. slowly coming down. This is however not recommended for newbies due to a high probability of making an error. Calibrate only when you are in range. There are two reasons to this: First reason is that you should not be too interested if you are 14 or 16 mmol/l or if you are 2,9 or 3,1 mmol/l. Either or, you know that you have a hyper or a hypo and you need to take actions. At this time the BG reading in the app and its accuracy does not matter that much. I.e. aim to get the in-range accuracy to be good and settle for that out-of-range accuracy might be so-so. Second reason is that the sensors themselves are the most accurate in range area and their inaccuracies increase when BG is outside the normal range. As we know, we want as accurate readings as possible, when calibrating, so you don't want to apply calibrations on top of inaccurate sensor readings. Of course, if the app says that you are out of range and shows 3,0 mmol/l but your actual BG (as per a finger prick) says 4,0 ( and your BG is steady), you can calibrate. No T1D wants to hear low alarms blazing, when they are not actually hypo'ing. Ensure you minimize the margin of error, when taking a finger prick : Use as accurate BG reader as possible. If you know that your sensor is inaccurate, consider updating it to a good one. Use strips that have not expired. While it's possible to use expired strips and get accurate readings with them as well, do you want to take the chance? Wash your hands before you take the reading. You might have some residues in your fingers, which impact the measurement - wash them off first. Don't squeeze your fingertip to get a blood drop out. Everyone knows how wild the sensor readings might be during the first 12-24 hours after a new sensor has been installed. This happens because the area where you applied the sensor is not yet used to the small filament that is inside your skin and via which the sensor takes readings. These sudden changes make also calibration more difficult. You can mitigate these if you attach a new sensor on your skin 12-24 hours before you actually take it in use . That way your skin has time to get used to the sensor and the readings are much more calm, when you start the sensor. If you calibrate during the 1st day of a sensor, that same calibration is most likely not accurate on the 10th day. It's good practice every once in a while to make a BG check with a finger prick when your BG is stable , and f the reading in Xdrip4iOS differs from that, you can consider calibrating. However, it doesn't necessarily make sense to calibrate if the difference is something like 0,1-0,4 mmol/l, because even the most accurate BG readers have some fault tolerance. It's more critical to be accurate in the lower-end of the scale than on the high side. So prioritize the accuracy of the low-end calibrations . For this it helps if you have installed (but not yet taken in to use) a new sensor but still taking the SG readings to Xdrip4iOS from the old one; when the readings are stable and at the low-end of the BG range, make a switch from old sensor to the new one. This way you can apply right away a good low-end calibration and be certain that at least the low alarms go off at the right time. You might screw an earlier nice calibration with just only one bad new calibration value. So don't calibrate for the sake of the calibration itself . When it comes to calibration, less is often more. You are not supposed to calibrate each and every day. If you feel like it and your BG is steady, you can do it, but it's completely fine to calibrate even just 3-4 times during the lifespan of a sensor. Make rather one good and accurate calibration than five sketchy ones.","title":"Calibration Best Practices"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#how-to-calibrate-in-xdrip4ios","text":"Alright, if you've read these instructions this far, you are ready for calibration. This section gives you instructions on how you will apply a new calibration in xDrip4iOS. Select the calibration method you want to use: either \"Single-point calibration\" or \"Multi-point calibration\". You can make this selection in \"Bluetooth\" tab in the app inside your transmitter. On the main screen of the app, click \"Calibrate\" If you have just connected a new sensor (or resetted the calibrations by stop->start sensor), the app does not allow you to calibrate right away. You need to wait until the app gets at least two BG readings from the sensor, before a calibration can be applied. A pop-up opens, which asks you to enter a calibration value. Here you enter the value from your BG reader after a finger prick. DONE! After this, the app calculates the calibration curve as per the provided calibration value and starts to apply a correction to all the further BG readings coming from the sensor. Depending on the size of the calibration you did, you may notice right away that the graph on the screen of Xdrip4iOS jumped up or down - this is completely normal. It is also normal that the next BG value is not exactly the same value that you just entered as a calibration value. This happens because the entered calibration value is first used to calculate the new calibration curve and only this calibration curve (see \"Advanced Calibration Explanations\") is used to calculate the shown BG values in the app. Remember to monitor the readings in the app after a calibration; if they start to go up or down within 15-20 mins, there is a chance that your BG was not actually steady at the moment of the calibration, i.e. your actual BG had already started to change, but because this change was not yet visible in the app, the calibration was not accurate. Practice makes perfect and over time you might learn to do a relatively accurate calibrations, even when your BG is going slowly up or down, but the ground rule is: BG steady and in range. Please note If you notice that the calibration that you applied was bad (for whatever reason) and made the BG readings inaccurate, you can reset all the calibrations by stopping and starting the sensor. Unfortunately it is not possible to remove individual calibration values If you change the calibration method, it resets all the previous calibrations.","title":"How to calibrate in xDrip4iOS?"},{"location":"configure/calibrate/#other-notes","text":"By default, xDrip4iOS has alerts to remind you to perform a calibration. If the app alerts you about this, it doesn't mean that you must do a new calibration. If you feel that these alerts/reminders occur too often, you can increase their interval. Often people turn calibration alerts even completely off. Sometimes a new calibration value makes the calibration slope and/or intercept to become something crazy without user noticing it right away. If you have a Nightscout installation, it is possible to see calibration curve there in the reports. There is a specific \"Calibrations\" report type for this. This report returns you the current and the past calibration graphs so that you can look at them and assess their accuracy. You can also compare the previous curve and the current curve and think how the calibration that you just did changed the curve. It is to be noted that in Nightscout reports, the calibration report shows the graph as inverted: sensor raw value is on Y axis and BG reading value after the calibration on the X axis. This means that you need to know how to read the graph and slope and intercept values reported by Nightscout - this part is not explained in these instructions more than these below: Values in these reports are shown based on 'mg/dl' and multiplied by 1000. On the report, the intercept value of \"-24000\" is actually a positive intercept of 24 mg/dl or 1,5 mmol/l On the report, the slope value of 1100 is actually slope of 0,91 (1/1,1)","title":"Other notes"},{"location":"configure/smartwatches/","text":"Connecting to Smartwatches \u2301 xDrip4iOS can be used with several other types of popular smartwatches although the way of using them to see your data with change depending on the type of smartwatch used.

Nightscout is one of the key pillars at the heart of the #wearenotwaiting community. We fully recommend all users to take advantage of this platform as it will open up many possibilities (sharing CGM data/alarms with family members, sharing CGM values to other devices, watches, tablets). Please see the main Nightscout documentation site for further information and set-up instructions. Further help and support can be found in the CGM In The Cloud Facebook group here In order to connect xDrip4iOS to Nightscout and upload your CGM data, in the Settings Menu, select Enable Nightscout . You should enter your Nightscout URL as per the service you are using. Examples (change mynightscout and 12345 as necessary) Heroku/Mongo : https://mynightscout.herokuapp.com ns.10be.de (1) : https://mynightscout.10be.de Port: 12345 ( Note: you'll find your URL, port and API secret in the Server page ) T1Pal : https://mynightscout.t1pal.com ( Note: you'll find your Uploader Url and Api Secret in the Uploaders page ) (1) If your URL needs a port number to access the service (such as the default mode of ns.10be.de), then enter this number in Port . Finally, enter your API_SECRET which should be a 12 character \"password\" that you configured when setting up your Nightscout installation. Without this, xDrip4iOS will not be able to write data to Nightscout.

Most users that decide to build from source will be people who are interested in collaborating in the development of the project or users who are used to DIY solutions (such as Loop or FreeAPS), have a valid Apple Developer license/account and are comfortable working with Xcode. Although xDrip4iOS is the common public name for the application, the actual Github project name is xdripswift and you will often so it referred to as this in the following documentation. The main project repository is here Ready? So then let's begin. Here are some of the things that you'll need before you're able to build and install the app: A Mac computer (iMac, MacBook etc). A valid Apple Developer account/license. If not, you could theoretically use a free Apple ID to sign the app with but you will have to remove Healthkit and NFC integration capabilities as well as needing to re-sign the app every 7 days. It's really not worth considering this path if you do not have a current Apple Developer account Xcode installed. This can be done from the App Store on your Mac. Git installed.

They will be clearly marked. The first thing to note is that you should use Install the Cocoa Pods Framework to your Mac \u2301 If this is the first time that you have built xDrip4iOS on your Mac, then you will need to install a set of frameworks called CocoaPods. If you have previously installed CocoaPods, you can skip this step. Enter the following command into Terminal. This must be done with admin rights, so we will use sudo (it will ask for your admin password): sudo gem install cocoapods This should install the dependencies onto your system and give you an OK message. Clone the xdripswift project \u2301 You should go into your Documents folder (or wherever you prefer) and run the following command to clone the xDrip4iOS project: git clone --branch=master --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JohanDegraeve/xdripswift This will create a new folder called xdripswift. Once completed we should navigate into this folder: cd xdripswift Install Cocoa Pods Dependencies \u2301 Earlier we installed the full Cocoa Pods framework onto your system.

The second option is more complex and needs a Mac and some knowledge/experience, but it allows you to modify the code and install custom versions as required. Anybody who is using xDrip4iOS for looping should always build from source. 1. Install Testflight \u2301 Please go to the App Store on your iPhone and search for \"testflight\". You should find the following app available. Click Get to install the app (you may be asked to confirm your Apple ID password). Once installed, open the Testflight app, press Continue at the start screen, Accept the terms and conditions and then Allow notifications. You can then exit the TestFlight app (there is no redeem code to enter) 2. Join the Beta Test \u2301 Once you have Testflight correctly installed, you can now join the xDrip4iOS Beta test.
